# math_lock_on_Roblox
Answer math questions to start Roblox


Leverage this code to put a simple "math lock" on Roblox. I use this to have my 1st grader  
answer a few math questions before Roblox will run. A simple way to add a little practice  
with an incentive to do it!

To install, follow the directions:

1. Download the python script
2. Download the *.bat file
3. Edit the *.bat file to point to the correct file locations
4. If you want to be tricky like me, you can also edit icons

Detailed instructions:

1. Python script:

   This is written for a 1st grader, so only includes addition and subtraction for nubmers 1 - 20.
   It also is ordered so that negative answers do not result. Edit as needed.

2. - 3. *.bat file:
   No additional settings should be needed

4. Adding icons

   To add an icon, you need a shortcut of the *.bat file. Put this shortcut on the desktop and hide
   the real *.bat file somewhere else. You can find icons by Right Click >> Properties >> Shotcut
   then click "Change Icon." Link the icon from the Roblox executible.

   If you don't know where your Roblox executible is, find it from the Roblox shortcut you probably
   have on the desktop.
